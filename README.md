# Infrastructure Troubleshooting Runbook

A dedicated, production-grade repository documenting real incidents, failures, 
root causes, fixes, and prevention steps across:

- Git

- Docker
- Kubernetes

This is my "Incident Knowledge Base" modeled after SRE/Platform Engineering teams.

Each incident is written with:
- Symptoms
